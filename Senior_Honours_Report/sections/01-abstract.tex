%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ABSTRACT IN HERE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The goal of this experiment and report is to investigate the occurrence of the Hall effect within p-type \& n-type semiconductors. This was accomplished by use of experimental apparatus  provided by the University, to determine the Hall voltages \& voltage drops of each semiconductor under varying magnetic fields and currents. With this data the Hall coefficient $R_{H}$, resistivity $p$, number density $n$ \& Hall mobilities $\mu$ of the charge carriers for each semiconductor could be determined.  
The goal of this project is to develop a method for collecting signal events from Photomultipler tube (PMT) data samples. An algorithm that reduces noise and can pick out signals with high efficiency was created. Using the aforementioned algorithm, properties of the PMT can be determined and consequently verified, such as a PMT's dark count.
