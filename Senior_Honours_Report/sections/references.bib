	abstract = {Numerous experimental efforts have shown that antineutrino-based monitoring provides a non-intrusive means to estimate the fissile content and relative thermal power of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. Until now, there have been no experimental demonstrations dedicated to exploring the nonproliferation potential of large detectors required for long-range monitoring. The goal of the Advanced Instrumentation Testbed (AIT) program is to test novel methods for the discovery of reactor cores, specifically in the mid-field to far-field, beyond 200 meters and out to tens or hundreds of kilometers, using kiloton-scale to megaton-scale detectors. The main physical infrastructure of the AIT consists of an underground laboratory in the Boulby mine in Northern England. The site is located at a 26-km standoff from the Hartlepool Reactor Complex, which houses two 1.5-GWth advanced gas-cooled reactors. The first detector to be deployed at the AIT is the WATer CHerenkov Monitor of ANtineutrinos (WATCHMAN). WATCHMAN will use {\textasciitilde}6,000 tons of gadolinium-doped water in order to detect a few reactor antineutrinos per week from the Hartlepool reactor complex. WATCHMAN will focus on understanding the signal efficiency, radiological backgrounds, and the reactor operational status. Here, the nonproliferation goals are to understand the sensitivity for discovery of one reactor in the presence of another, the discovery of any reactor operations above a well-understood background, and the sensitivity to confirm the declared operational cycles of both reactors. Uniquely, AIT-WATCHMAN also offers a flexible platform at which nascent technologies such as water-based scintillator and fast photomultiplier tubes can be tested in real-world conditions. We present the AIT-WATCHMAN program and status.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses C˘erenkov radiation. Various substances, including solutions of mineral salts, emit a feeble light under the influence of radiations from radioactive substances. It was discovered in the course of time that this was, in general, fluorescent light that behaved in much the same way as did that emitted from certain substances under irradiation by ultraviolet light. While investigating the luminescence of solutions of uranyl salts under the influence of γ-rays, C˘erenkov discovered in 1934 that a very weak radiation was visible even from pure liquids. The C˘erenkov detector has proved to be a very useful tool in nuclear and cosmic-ray physics, for it has the merits of great speed, high efficiency, and marked directional properties. It is also simple to construct and does not in general require rare materials. Its applications are, however, somewhat restricted by the very nature of the phenomenon of the C˘erenkov radiation, though it is likely that its usage will increase in the near future as ever higher and higher energy particles become available from the new types of accelerating machines.},

	abstract = {This article describes the physics and nonproliferation goals of WATCHMAN, the WAter Cherenkov Monitor for ANtineutrinos. The baseline WATCHMAN design is a kiloton scale gadolinium-doped (Gd) light water Cherenkov detector, placed 13 kilometers from a civil nuclear reactor in the United States. In its first deployment phase, WATCHMAN will be used to remotely detect a change in the operational status of the reactor, providing a first- ever demonstration of the potential of large Gd-doped water detectors for remote reactor monitoring for future international nuclear nonproliferation applications. During its first phase, the detector will provide a critical large-scale test of the ability to tag neutrons and thus distinguish low energy electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. This would make WATCHMAN the only detector capable of providing both direction and flavor identification of supernova neutrinos. It would also be the third largest supernova detector, and the largest underground in the western hemisphere. In a follow-on phase incorporating the IsoDAR neutrino beam, the detector would have world-class sensitivity to sterile neutrino signatures and to non-standard electroweak interactions (NSI). WATCHMAN will also be a major, U.S. based integration platform for a host of technologies relevant for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and other future large detectors. This white paper describes the WATCHMAN conceptual design,and presents the results of detailed simulations of sensitivity for the project's nonproliferation and physics goals. It also describes the advanced technologies to be used in WATCHMAN, including high quantum efficiency photomultipliers, Water-Based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS), picosecond light sensors such as the Large Area Picosecond Photo Detector (LAPPD), and advanced pattern recognition and particle identification methods.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary Electron emission from solids may be induced by various means: high temperatures, strong electric fields, and bombardment with photons or particles, particularly charged particles. The chapter discusses the emission induced by electron bombardment called as “secondary electron emission,” discovered during a study of the reflection of electrons from metals. The theory of secondary emission is far from complete. The main reason for this state of affairs is the complexity of the problem, which becomes evident when one considers qualitatively what happens in the secondary emission process. This first step in the process presumably involves the interaction of a beam of incident electrons of energies in the range between 100 ev–10 kev with the solid. This leads to a cascade process of ionization and excitation, combined with elastic and inelastic scattering of the cascade electrons. The second step is concerned with the number of cascade electrons that escape from the surface and with their energy distribution.},

In multiplying the charge produced by incident light by up to 100 million times, these devices are essential to a wide range of functions, from medical instrumentation to astronomical observations. This complete and authoritative guide will provide students, practitioners, and researchers with a deeper understanding of the operating principles of these devices. Authored by an experienced user and manufacturer of photomultipliers, this handbook gives the reader insights into photomultiplier behaviour as a means to optimize performance. Diffuse and low level light sources are best served with a photomultiplier for the detection of single photon emissions. Light detection and electron multiplication are statistical in nature and the mathematics of these processes is derived from first principles. The book covers other related topics such as scintillation counting, light guides, and large area detectors. The usually complicated subject of biasing a photomultiplier, very important for optimal performance, is reduced to a comprehensible set of calculations. All applications demand some form of electronics, the options for which are fully explored in this book.},

	abstract = {A measurement result is incomplete without a statement of its 'uncertainty' or 'margin of error'. But what does this statement actually tell us? By examining the practical meaning of probability, this book discusses what is meant by a '95 percent interval of measurement uncertainty', and how such an interval can be calculated. The book argues that the concept of an unknown 'target value' is essential if probability is to be used as a tool for evaluating measurement uncertainty. It uses statistical concepts, such as a conditional confidence interval, to present 'extended' classical methods for evaluating measurement uncertainty. The use of the Monte Carlo principle for the simulation of experiments is described. Useful for researchers and graduate students, the book also discusses other philosophies relating to the evaluation of measurement uncertainty. It employs clear notation and language to avoid the confusion that exists in this controversial field of science.},

Since these phenomena are so very different basically, this article will be devoted exclusively to the more fundamental aspects of the experimental and the theoretical investigations of the phenomenon of electron emission from heated conductors.},

	abstract = {The Richardson equation appropriate to thermionic emission in Schottky barrier diodes is derived. For a semiconductor having an energy band with ellipsoidal constant-energy surfaces in momentum space, the Richardson constant A1∗ associated with a single energy minimum is A∗1=4φqk2h3(l2mymz+m2mzmx+n2mxmy)12 where l, m and n are the direction cosines of the normal to the emitting plane relative to the principal axes of the ellipsoid and mx, my and mz are the components of the effective mass tensor. In the Ge conduction band, summation of emission from all the energy minima gives maximum and minimum ratios of A∗ to the free electron value A (= 120 A/cm2/°K2) of 1·19 and 1·07 for the 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 directions respectively. In the silicon conduction band, maximum and minimum ratios of 2·15 and 2·05 occur for the 〈111〉 and 〈100〉 directions respectively. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental results from W-Si and Au-GaAs diodes.
Résumé
L'équation de Richardson appropriée à l'émission thermionique dans les diodes à barrière Schottky est dérivée. Pour un semiconducteur ayant une bande d'énergie avec des surfaces ellipsoïdales à énergie constante dans l'espace de quantité de mouvement, la constante de Richardson A1* associée à un minimum d'énergie simple est: A∗1=4φqk2h3(l2mymz+m2mzmx+n2mxmy)12 où l,m et n sont les cosinus directeurs de la normale au plan émetteur relatif aux axes principales de l'ellipsoïde et mx, my et mz sont les composantes du tenseur de masse effectif. Dans la bande de conduction de Ge, la somme des émissions de tous les minima d'énergie donne des rapports maxima et minima d'A* à la valeur d'électrons libres A (= 120 A/cm2/°K2) d'1,19 et 1,07 pour les directions 〈100〉 et 〈111〉 respectivement. Dans la bande de conduction de silicium, des rapports maxima et minima 2,15 et 2,05 se produisent pour les directions 〈111〉 et 〈100〉 respectivement. Les prédictions théoriques sont en bon accord avec les résultats expérimentaux obtenus des diodes de Wi-Si et Au-AsGa.
Zusammenfassung
Richardsons Gleichung für die thermionische Emission in Schottky Sperrschichtdioden wird abgeleitet. Für einen Halbleiter, der ein Energieband mit ellipsenförmigen Oberflächen konstanter Energie im Impulsraum besitzt, ist die mit einem einzelnen Energie-minimum verknüpfte Richardsonsche Konstante A∗1=4φqk2h3(l2mymz+m2mzmx+n2mxmy)12 wo l, m und n die Richtungskosinusse der Normalen zur Emissionsebene in Bezug auf die Hauptachsen des Ellipsoids sind, und mx, my und mz die Komponenten des effektiven Massentensors. Im Leitungsband von Ge ergibt die Addition der Emission von allen Energieminima maximale und minimale Verhältnisse von A∗ zur freien Elektronenmasse A (= 120 A/cm2/°K2) von 1,19 und 1,07 für die 〈100〉- und 〈111〉-Richtungen. Im Leitungsband von Silizium findet man maximale und minimale Verhältnisse von 2,15 und 2,05 für die 〈111〉- und 〈100〉-Richtungen. Die theoretischen Voraussagen stehen in guter Übereinstimmung mit Versuchsergebnissen an Wi-Si- und Au-GaAs-Dioden.},
