\section{Acknowledgements} \label{sec:ack}

I would like to thank my supervisors Dr. Needham and Dr. Smith, for their assistance and guidance throughout the project without which the project would have surely suffered.

All code developed for this project was uploaded to \textit{Github}, which allowed me to develop it with ease while on the move. The full project code can be found \href{https://github.com/CasperMcTavish/SHProjectSignalDetection}{here} for the foreseeable future. Please feel free to fork the repository if you wish to use it, and if this link no longer works feel free to email me at the link on the cover.
